This Android application has been primarly developed for the painting exhibitions of Prof. Alberto Pelagalli, an Italian artist.
I also used a different version of this work as the final project of the *"Telematics Applications"* course during my Master's degree course in Computer Engineering at the University of Naples Federico II.

The app is designed as a *client-server* architecture and developed in `Java`. It is composed by several parts, as shown in the *sidebar*, and is only in Italian language.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/strati_animo_project/screen-0.jpg" title="screen-0" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>

<h2 class="title mt-4 p-0 text-left">Gallery ("Galleria")</h2>

The **gallery** (Italian: *Galleria*) is the main functionality of the app.
It represents the core of the ***multi-experiential*** visit at the painting exhibition: for each artwork, there is a song and a specific description associated to it, which aims to immerse the visitor in the picture.

The displayed example represents a flutist wearing a costume and the painting is titled *"Spensieratezza"* (i.e. lightheartedness).
The associated song is *"Hakuna Matata"* by Elton John from "The Lion King" with the following description:

> "Hakuna Matata" is a sentence in *swahili* language (the national language in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda) and it can be translated as *"no worries"*. Popularized by the famous Disney animated movie "The Lion King", the *hakuna matata* philosophy invites us to forget the problems of the past and focus optimistically on the present. The proposed song is the version sung by Timon, Pumbaa and Simba; with music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice, it received an Oscar nomination for Best Song and is ranked 90th in the American Film Institute's list of the best American film songs.

<h2 class="title mt-4 p-0 text-left">Critique ("Critica")</h2>

The **critique** functionality (Italian: *Critica*) includes comments to the painting exhibition written by three local representatives:
- *Prof. Mario Luigi Luciani*, the school manager of the institution where the first exhibition took places;
- *Prof. Marialuisa Lancia*, a journalist;
- *Dr. Emanuela Patriarca*, a poetess, historian and cinema critic.
