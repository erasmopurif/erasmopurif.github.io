In this thesis work, I developed a system providing the integration between *Content-Based Image Retrieval* (CBIR) and *Geographic Information Retrieval* (GIR).
My work aimed to prove that the use of geographic data can improve the results obtained by an *image matching* system based only on multimedia/visual data.

This work is part of a wide project about cultural heritage, in which a mobile application that helps users to retrieve information about artworks and museums has been developed. The logic architecture is shown in the figure below where the highlighted components represent the area I implemented.
