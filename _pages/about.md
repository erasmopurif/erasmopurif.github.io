I am a Scientific Project Officer at the [European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency](https://algorithmic-transparency.ec.europa.eu/index_en) (ECAT) of the **European Commission**'s [Joint Research Centre](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/joint-research-centre_en) (JRC).

I work at the intersection between scientific research and policy-making, with a specific focus on Human Behaviour and Machine Intelligence ([HUMAINT](https://ai-watch.ec.europa.eu/humaint_en)).
On the research side, I carry out studies in the area of trustworthy algorithmic systems, e.g. defining methodologies for ensuring fairness, transparency, human oversight and social well-being and analysing their impact on fundamental rights, the related societal risks and potential mitigation measures.
On the policy side, I support the enforcement of the **AI Act** and the **Digital Services Act**, collaborating with policy units, high-level experts and academic institutions.

I am also a Ph.D. candidate at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.inf.ovgu.de/en/) of the [Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/en/) (OVGU), working with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ernesto W. De Luca](http://www.gei.de/en/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-ing-ernesto-william-de-luca.html) in the [Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence](https://hcai.ovgu.de/) research group.
Starting from the analysis of the fairness capabilities of state-of-the-art **Graph Neural Networks for behavioural user modeling**, my doctoral research focuses on proposing innovative approaches for **bias detection** and **mitigation** in **multiclass and multigroup scenarios**, by also providing ways for monitoring the results via novel **explainable user interfaces**.

Before joining ECAT and JRC, I was employed for four and a half years as a Research and Teaching Assistant at the OVGU, and a Research Fellow in the [Human-Centred Technologies for Educational Media](https://www.gei.de/en/institute/departments/human-centered-technologies-for-educational-media) department of the [Leibniz Institute for Educational Media \| Georg Eckert Institute](http://www.gei.de/en/home.html) (GEI), where I co-coordinated the development of the institute's **Usability Lab** and was involved in the establishment of a **systematic user monitoring** process for the digital infrastructures and services.
Previously, I worked for three years as an IT Consultant at [Blue Reply](https://www.reply.com/blue-reply/it/) with project management and AI systems development roles.

I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Engineering at [University of Naples](http://www.unina.it/en_GB/home) and a 2<sup>nd</sup> level Master degree in Artificial Intelligence at [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/).
