I am a Research Assistant and a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.inf.ovgu.de/en/) of the [Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/en/), working with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ernesto W. De Luca](http://www.gei.de/en/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-ing-ernesto-william-de-luca.html) in the [Digital Transformation and Digital Humanities](https://www.dtdh.ovgu.de/) research group.
My research focuses on the implementation of a **behavioural user profiling** framework focusing on three *beyond-accuracy* perspectives: ***privacy***, to study how to intervene on graph data structures and provide methods to make the data available without neither exposing personal user information nor corrupting profiles creation; ***fairness***, to provide user representations that are free of any inherited discrimination by developing debiasing approaches; ***explainability***, to produce understandable descriptions of the framework results by designing an adaptive and personalised user interface which provides tailored explanations to the end-users, depending on their specific user profiles.

I am also employed as a Research Fellow in the [Digital Information and Research Infrastructure](http://www.gei.de/en/departments/digital-information-and-research-infrastructures.html) department of the [Leibniz Institute for Educational Media \| Georg Eckert Institute](http://www.gei.de/en/home.html), where I coordinate the development of the institute's **Usability Lab** and am involved in the establishment of a **systematic user monitoring** process for the digital infrastructures and services.

Before I joined OVGU and GEI, I worked for three as an IT Consultant at [Blue Reply](https://www.reply.com/blue-reply/it/) with project management and AI systems development roles.
Previously, I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Engineering at [University of Naples](http://www.unina.it/en_GB/home) and a 2<sup>nd</sup> level Master degree in Artificial Intelligence at [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/).
