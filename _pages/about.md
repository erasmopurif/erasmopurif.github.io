I am a Research Assistant and a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.inf.ovgu.de/en/) of the [Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/en/) (OVGU), working with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ernesto W. De Luca](http://www.gei.de/en/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-ing-ernesto-william-de-luca.html) in the [Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence](https://hcai.ovgu.de/) research group.
Starting from the analysis of the fairness capabilities of state-of-the-art **user profiling Graph Neural Network-based models**, my doctoral research focuses on presenting innovative **human-centred approaches** for **bias detection** and **mitigation** on this specific domain and technological architectures, by also providing ways for monitoring the results via novel **explainable user interfaces**, which are a crucial concept of any Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) system.

I am also employed as a Research Fellow in the [Human-Centred Technologies for Educational Media](https://www.gei.de/en/institute/departments/human-centered-technologies-for-educational-media) department of the [Leibniz Institute for Educational Media \| Georg Eckert Institute](http://www.gei.de/en/home.html) (GEI), where I co-coordinate the development of the institute's **Usability Lab** and am involved in the establishment of a **systematic user monitoring** process for the digital infrastructures and services.

Before I joined OVGU and GEI, I worked for three as an IT Consultant at [Blue Reply](https://www.reply.com/blue-reply/it/) with project management and AI systems development roles.
Previously, I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Engineering at [University of Naples](http://www.unina.it/en_GB/home) and a 2<sup>nd</sup> level Master degree in Artificial Intelligence at [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/).
