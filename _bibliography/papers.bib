  title={What are we missing in Algorithmic Fairness? Discussing Open Challenges for Fairness Analysis in User Profiling with Graph Neural Networks},
  author={Purificato, Erasmo and De Luca, Ernesto William},
  abstract={Due to the rising importance of human-centred perspectives in artificial intelligence and all related fields, algorithmic fairness is currently a key topic when dealing with research on novel machine learning models and applications. However, in most cases, in the context of fairness analysis, we are commonly facing situations in which the fairness metrics are applied only in binary classification scenarios, and the capability of a model to produce fair results is evaluated considering the absolute difference of the scores of the two sensitive groups considered. In this paper, we aim to discuss these two open challenges and illustrate our position from an ethical perspective. To support our arguments, we present a case study on two recent scientific contributions exploiting Graph Neural Networks models for user profiling, which are considered state-of-the-art technologies in many domains. With the presented work, our goal is also to create a valuable debate in the community about the raised questions.},

  title={FACADE: Fake Articles Classification and Decision Explanation},
  author={Purificato, Erasmo and Shahania, Saijal and Thiel, Marcus and De Luca, Ernesto William},
  abstract={The daily use of social networks and the resulting dissemination of disinformation over those media have greatly contributed to the rise of the fake news phenomenon as a global problem. Several manual and automatic approaches are currently in place to try to tackle and defuse this issue, which is becoming nearly uncontrollable. In this paper, we propose Facade, a fake news detection system that aims to provide a complete solution for classifying news articles and explain the motivation behind every prediction. The system is designed with a cascading architecture composed of two classification pipelines dealing with either low-level or high-level descriptors, with the overall goal of achieving a consistent confidence score on each outcome. In addition, the system is equipped with an explainable user interface through which fact-checkers and content managers can visualise in detail the features leading to a certain prediction and have the possibility for manual cross-checking.},

  title={Tell Me Why It's Fake: Developing an Explainable User Interface for a Fake News Detection System},
  author={Purificato, Erasmo and Shahania, Saijal and De Luca, Ernesto William},
  abstract={In this paper, we present the design and development of an explainable user interface for a fake news detection system. The problem of distinguishing real from fake articles gained a lot of popularity in the last few years, mainly due to the soaring diffusion of social networks and internet bots as means for propaganda and disinformation sharing. By leveraging various explainability methods, i.e. feature importance, partial dependence plots and SHAP values, we aim to show how the combination of different techniques embedded in an interactive user interface can lead to enhance trust in a detection system for a non-expert user, such as a fact-checker or a content manager. Through several examples, we describe all the explainability components along with the benefits and limitations they can provide to end users.},

The effectiveness of an approach is usually assessed with accuracy-based perspectives, where the capability to predict user features (such as gender or age) is evaluated. In this work, we perform a beyond-accuracy analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches to assess the presence of disparate impact and disparate mistreatment, meaning that users characterised by a given sensitive feature are unintentionally, but systematically, classified worse than their counterparts. Our analysis on two real-world datasets shows that different user profiling paradigms can impact fairness results.

  abstract={The availability of videos has grown rapidly in recent years. Finding and browsing relevant information to be automatically extracted from videos is not an easy task, but today it is an indispensable feature due to the immense number of digital products available. In this paper, we present a system which provides a process to automatically extract information from videos. We describe a system solution that uses a re-trained OpenNLP model to locate all the places and famous people included in a specific video. The system obtains information from the Google Knowledge Graph related to relevant named entities such as places or famous people. In this paper we will also present the Automatic Georeferencing Video (AGV) system developed by RAI (Radiotelevisione italiana, which is the national public broadcasting company of Italy, owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance) Teche for the European Project “La Città Educante” (The Educating City: teaching and learning processes in cross-media ecosystem) Our system contributes to The Educating City project by providing the technological environment to create statistical models for automatic named entity recognition (NER), and has been implemented in the field of education, in Italian initially. The system has been applied to the learning challenges facing the world of educational media and has demonstrated how beneficial combining topical news content with scientific content can be in education.},

  abstract = {Despite the existing skepticism about the use of automatic systems in contexts where human knowledge and experience are considered indispensable (e.g., the granting of a mortgage, the prediction of stock prices, or the detection of cancers), our work aims to show how the use of explainability and fairness techniques can lead to the growth of a domain expert's trust and reliance on an artificial intelligence (AI) system. This article presents a system, applied to the context of loan approval processes, focusing on the two aforementioned ethical principles out of the four defined by the High-Level Expert Group on AI in the document “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI,” published in April 2019, in which the key requirements that AI systems should meet to be considered trustworthy are identified. The presented case study is realized within a proprietary framework composed of several components for supporting the user throughout the management of the whole life cycle of a machine learning model. The main approaches, consisting of providing an interpretation of the model's outputs and monitoring the model's decisions to detect and react to unfair behaviors, are described in more detail to compare our system within state-of-the-art related frameworks. Finally, a novel Trust \& Reliance Scale is proposed for evaluating the system, and a usability test is performed to measure the user satisfaction with the effectiveness of the developed user interface; results are obtained, respectively, by the submission of the mentioned novel scale to bank domain experts and the usability questionnaire to a heterogeneous group composed of loan officers, data scientists, and researchers.},

  abstract={Adaptation and personalization are crucial aspects of the design and development of successful Artificial Intelligence systems, from search engines and recommender systems to wearable devices. The increased desire for customization inevitably leads to the need for the end-user to understand the rationale behind displaying that specific tailored content. User interfaces play a central role to provide the right explanations to the end-users. While adaptive and personalized user interfaces are well-known and advanced research fields, a common issue we face in terms of explainability is finding intelligent user interfaces following the one-fits-all paradigm without considering the different peculiarities of individuals. The 1st Workshop on Adaptive and Personalized Explainable User Interfaces (APEx-UI 2022) aims to foster a cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary discussion between experts from different fields (e.g. computer science, psychology, sociology, law, medicine, business, etc.) in order to answer a precise research question: How can we adapt and personalize explainable user interfaces to the needs, demands and requirements of different end-users, considering their distinct knowledge, background and expertise?},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the design and the implementation of a knowledge graph-based recommender system for research paper suggestion, along with two explainable interfaces which provide different types of explanations to the users interacting with the recommender. Our work, developed within the academic context of the Georg Eckert Institute for International Textbook Research, aims to assess the effectiveness of the explanation among the researchers of the institute and understand which characteristics of the interfaces themselves are perceived to be as most interpretable, leading to increase the trust and confidence in the recommender system and its credibility. We evaluated our work through a user study performed among different experts covering several research fields. All participants were asked to take part in an online survey, and a focus group answered some targeted interviews. This last qualitative evaluation aims better to understand the interaction patterns within the two explainable interfaces. The results show the greater effectiveness of the interface providing the explanation through a natural language sentence and displaying the graph path from the user to the recommended paper.},

  title={Dynamic Privacy-Preserving Recommendations on Academic Graph Data},
  author={Purificato, Erasmo and Wehnert, Sabine and De Luca, Ernesto William},
  abstract={In the age of digital information, where the internet and social networks, as well as personalised systems, have become an integral part of everyone's life, it is often challenging to be aware of the amount of data produced daily and, unfortunately, of the potential risks caused by the indiscriminate sharing of personal data. Recently, attention to privacy has grown thanks to the introduction of specific regulations such as the European GDPR. In some fields, including recommender systems, this has inevitably led to a decrease in the amount of usable data, and, occasionally, to significant degradation in performance mainly due to information no longer being attributable to specific individuals. In this article, we present a dynamic privacy-preserving approach for recommendations in an academic context. We aim to implement a personalised system capable of protecting personal data while at the same time allowing sensible and meaningful use of the available data. The proposed approach introduces several pseudonymisation procedures based on the design goals described by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity in their guidelines, in order to dynamically transform entities (e.g., persons) and attributes (e.g., authored papers and research interests) in such a way that any user processing the data are not able to identify individuals. We present a case study using data from researchers of the Georg Eckert Institute for International Textbook Research (Brunswick, Germany). Building a knowledge graph and exploiting a Neo4j database for data management, we first generate several pseudoN-graphs, being graphs with different rates of pseudonymised persons. Then, we evaluate our approach by leveraging the graph embedding algorithm node2vec to produce recommendations through node relatedness. The recommendations provided by the graphs in different privacy-preserving scenarios are compared with those provided by the fully non-pseudonymised graph, considered as the baseline of our evaluation. The experimental results show that, despite the structural modifications to the knowledge graph structure due to the de-identification processes, applying the approach proposed in this article allows for preserving significant performance values in terms of precision.},

  title={A Multimodal Approach for Cultural Heritage Information Retrieval},
  author={Purificato, Erasmo and Rinaldi, Antonio Maria},
  abstract={The daily use of mobile devices and the expansion of the world-wide-web lead multimedia information to an uncontrolled growth. In this context, the use of smart interfaces and the combination of different features in the information retrieval process are crucial aspects. In particular, for a cultural heritage application it is important to consider that a digitized artwork is only a representation of a real object, represented under specific conditions (camera position, brightness, etc.). These issues could be causes of alterations during the features extraction task. In this paper we propose a multimodal approach for cultural heritage information retrieval combining geographic and visual data. Our approach has been implemented in a mobile system based on open source technologies. It is composed of three main parts related to image matching functionalities, Geographic Information Retrieval task, and a combination strategy for multimedia and geographic data integration. An Android application has been developed to give a user friendly interface and a case study together with some experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach for the user satisfaction.},

  abstract={In this paper a system providing an efficient integration between Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) is presented. Over the years, many CBIR systems have been proposed to give a solution for an efficient use of multimedia/visual contents and other issues as performance, quality of retrieval, data heterogeneity, and multimodal information integration. The aim of the proposed approach is to prove that the use of geographic data can improve the results obtained by an image matching system based only on visual data. Our framework is composed of three parts, each of them described in detail in this paper: the first part is dedicated to CBIR, with an experimental comparison of a large number of different multimedia features to choose the one to use in the system implementation; in the second part the methodology to integrate geographic and multimedia data is showed; in the last part is presented a GIR system implementation using a “points of interest” search. An Android application has been developed for the client-side using Apache Solr as server side provider for the information retrieval functionalities. An experimental evaluation is carried out to demonstrate the effective improvement given by the combination of geographic and multimedia data. Our results have been obtained using a real dataset composed of artworks located in Naples's museums.},
